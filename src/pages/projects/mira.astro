    <p class="m-0">
      Mira is a chatbot from Mitsubishi to help customer view product, book a
      service and test drive, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, I was responsible for maintaining a chatbot deployed
      across WhatsApp, Web, and Mobile platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I improved the chatbotâ€™s user experience by redesigning the interface from
      text-based to button-based interactions. Additionally, I developed a
      queuing system for live customer service agents and ensured the
      reliability of key features such as service booking, product information
      delivery, and payment simulations. I also supported the sales team by
      automating the mass delivery of promotional messages to customers via
      WhatsApp.
