	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I’m a front-end-focused web developer with over 2 years of experience building responsive, accessible, and user-friendly web interfaces using modern technologies like React, Laravel (Blade), and TypeScript. I enjoy turning ideas into polished, interactive experiences that not only look great but work smoothly across devices.</p>
	<p>I'm based in Bandung, Indonesia, and began my professional journey at Radya Labs Teknologi (now Radya Digital) where I started as a Web & Chatbot Developer intern in August 2021. I was then offered a part-time Web Developer role, which lasted until November 2022, and continued on as a full-time Web Developer for another year. During my time there, I worked on various real-world projects across e-commerce, chatbots, and internal tools. Alongside my work experience, I'm currently completing my Informatics Engineering degree at UNIKOM Indonesia.</p>
	<p>I’m passionate about learning new technologies and solving real-world problems through code. Whether it’s experimenting with a new framework, improving UI/UX, or finding ways to make systems run more efficiently, I’m always excited to explore, build, and grow.</p>
	<p>If you’re interested in working together or just want to connect, feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear from you.</p>
