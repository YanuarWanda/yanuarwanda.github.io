  <Card title="About Me">
    <p>
      I’m a web developer with over <strong>2 years of experience</strong> building
      end-to-end web solutions using modern technologies like React, Laravel (Blade),
      and .NET. I enjoy turning ideas into polished, interactive experiences that
      not only look great but work smoothly across devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm based in Bandung, Indonesia, and began my professional journey at
      Radya Labs Teknologi (now Radya Digital) where I started as a Web &
      Chatbot Developer intern in August 2021. I was then offered a part-time
      Web Developer role, which lasted until November 2022, and continued on as
      a full-time Web Developer for another year. During my time there, I worked
      on various real-world projects across e-commerce, chatbots, and internal
      tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about learning new technologies and solving real-world
      problems through code. Whether it’s experimenting with a new framework,
      improving UI/UX, or finding ways to make systems run more efficiently, I’m
      always excited to explore, build, and grow.
